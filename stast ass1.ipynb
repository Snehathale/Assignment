If a measure is nominal, then you know that you would never average the data values or do a t-test on the data.\n",

To collect this information, researchers simply had to classify something into a pre-defined category. Categories showed no order apart from membership based on some criteria.

    "how each measure can be used to describe a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: This is the most familiar one, often called the \"average.\" It's calculated by adding all the values in a dataset and dividing by the number of values. The mean is a good choice when the data is symmetrical and free of extreme outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is the \"middle value\" when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order. If you have an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is less sensitive to outliers compared to the mean, making it useful for skewed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The mode is simply the most frequent value in a dataset. It can be particularly informative when you're dealing with categorical data, but it can also exist for numerical data. Datasets can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or even more (multimodal).\n",
    "\n",
    "How they describe a dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a dataset representing the test scores of 50 students. The mean would tell you the average score, indicating the overall level of performance. The median would reveal the score that divides the higher-scoring half from the lower-scoring half. The mode would show the most common score, potentially highlighting a specific range where many students scored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Variability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: This is the simplest measure, calculated as the difference between the highest and lowest values in the dataset. The range gives a basic idea of how spread out the data is, but it can be misleading if there are outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: The variance is the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It represents how spread out the data is around the average value. A higher variance indicates greater spread, while a lower variance suggests the data points are closer to the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It's expressed in the same units as the original data, making it easier to interpret the spread compared to variance. Similar to variance, a higher standard deviation shows more variation in the data, while a lower standard deviation indicates the data is clustered around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "How they describe a dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing with the test score example, the range would tell you the difference between the highest and lowest scores. The variance and standard deviation would provide a more nuanced picture of how spread out the scores are. A high standard deviation would suggest a wider range of scores, with students performing significantly above or below the average. A low standard deviation would indicate the scores are clustered closer to the mean, suggesting a more uniform performance across the class.\n",
