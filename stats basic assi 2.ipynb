    "Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "A normal distribution is symmetrical. The data points are distributed evenly on either side of the center, forming a bell-shaped curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean represents the average of all values, and in a symmetrical distribution, it will fall right in the center where the data is most concentrated.\n",

    "The median is the middle value when the data is ordered. In a symmetrical distribution, the middle value will also coincide with the center where most of the data accumulates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mode is the most frequent value. Because the data is symmetrical, there will be a single peak in the center, making the most frequent value the one that falls right in the middle again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in a normal distribution,  mean = median = mode. This unique characteristic helps us identify if a distribution is likely normal by comparing these measures of central tendency. If they are close or exactly the same, it suggests normality."

    "Outliers, data points significantly different from the rest, can significantly impact how we interpret central tendency and dispersion. Here's a breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean (average): Outliers heavily influence the mean. A single very high or low value can pull the mean in its direction, misrepresenting the \"typical\" data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: Outliers have less influence on the median. The median is the middle value when data is ordered, so extreme values on either side don't affect it as much.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: Outliers won't affect the mode (the most frequent value) unless they become the new most frequent value themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: Outliers can drastically increase the range, the difference between the highest and lowest values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance & Standard Deviation: Similar to the mean, outliers can inflate variance and standard deviation, again misrepresenting how spread out the data is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a dataset of test scores: 70, 80, 85, 90, 95, and 150. The outlier (150) would significantly increase the mean score, making it seem like students performed better than they actually did. The median (around 85) would be a more accurate reflection of the typical score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the Right Measure:\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing how outliers affect different measures is crucial. If outliers are present, consider using the median or other robust statistics less sensitive to extremes for central tendency, and alternative measures like interquartile range (IQR) for dispersion."
